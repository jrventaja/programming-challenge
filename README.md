# Programming Challenge Media Catalog

Steps to run/test

## Step 1

Unzip the zip/gz files with the compressor of your choice (I use 7zip). This will result in 3 .tsv files.

## Step 2

Set the variables at DataLoaderTool\appsettings.json:
Section "Paths":
"PeopleData" should refer to the "name.basics" file;
"MediaData" should refer to the "title.basics" file;
"RatingData" should refer to the "title.ratings" file.\

e.g:"PeopleData": "C:\\Users\\joser\\Documents\\Projects\\programming-challenge\\dataset\\name.basics.tsv\\data.tsv",
    "MediaData": "C:\\Users\\joser\\Documents\\Projects\\programming-challenge\\dataset\\title.basics.tsv\\data.tsv",
    "RatingData": "C:\\Users\\joser\\Documents\\Projects\\programming-challenge\\dataset\\title.ratings.tsv\\data.tsv"


## Step 3

(Install SQL SERVER EXPRESS if you don't have it, and then) run the scripts contained at "DDL Scripts.sql" individually.

## Step 4

Run "dotnet build" and then "dotnet run" at cmd while at the solution folder. (You need .NET FRAMEWORK CORE 2.1 installed)
It will take some time to load, because of the data size. After that, all tables are loaded with the data that was provided.

## Step 5

Time to run the service application, so we can receive requests through our API. Edit the file at "MediaCatalog\MediaCatalog\appsettings.json" setting the ConnectionStrings/Storage/Server with the address your SQL Server is listening (usually LOCALHOST\SQLEXPRESS if you are not using a VM to run the application - e.g Docker).
Use "dotnet build" and then "dotnet run" at MediaCatalog solution.

## Step 6

Your application will be listening on port 44304 and is able to be tested.
